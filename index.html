In my first year at HolidayIQ.com, in close collaboration with Product Management I successfully redesigned the HolidayIQ.com website along with a refreshing section called  <a href="http://www.holidayiq.com/holiday-ideas" target="_blank">HolidayIdeas</a> aimed at inspiring travelers to take a break! I was completely hands-on and led the project end-to-end. After 15 months, I now lead a team of 3 designers supporting me in various product and marketing initiatives for HolidayIQ.com. The design efforts so far have contributed to leads increasing 10-fold and click conversion doubling on the site.</p></div>

The 200 strong internal team of quality reviewers handled Ad Quality and worked with several standalone legacy tools. The tools allowed them to wean out objectionable ad material like porn, gambling etc. from the networks. However the tools were inefficient and were a nightmare in terms of usability. I anchored user studies to identify issues with core workflows, led co-design sessions and designed a robust integrated digital workspace for Ad reviewers.</p></div>

				<p class="splitLeft">I grew up in Chembur, a middle-class industrial township in Bombay. I was active in sports, Cricket was a passion and led my school and college teams as captain in local tournaments. I was always a voracious reader and loved comics which inspired me to draw and sketch obsessively, paving the way for a BFA (Applied Art) at the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art, Mumbai. While working as a Web Designer at a tech startup in Bombay around the time of the dotcom bust in 2000, I got accepted as Masters student to study Service Design at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy. The experience at Ivrea provided me with an opportunity to travel the world, make friends and work with some of the best designers in the industry. It left a lasting impression on me and helped shape my career.</p><p>The 3 year stint in Singapore after my Masters was equally rewarding. I picked up some core project management chops, learnt to eat with chopsticks and travelled extensively around South-East Asia. I discovered along the way that I can be a good guide and mentor to younger designers. I started out disastrously as a public speaker but now I have a better grasp on conducting design workshops, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/deepux/presentations" target="_blank">presenting at design conferences</a> and teaching. On a personal note, I am socially outgoing, not very religious but spiritually inclined. Love the company of friends and family, dig the outdoors, motorcycle rides, meditation. Adore dogs. And always look forward to some weekend cooking. I currently live and work in landlocked Bangalore with my wife and miss the heady aroma of coastal mangroves of Bombay and Singapore.</p>

						<h3>Recommendations &#8594; Linkedin.com</h3>
						<blockquote>Deepak is easily one of the most versatile, vibrant, and well-rounded Visual Interaction Designers I’ve worked with. What makes Deepak unique is his diversified creative graph and his desire to design out-of-the-box. From foundational stints in advertising in Mumbai to Service Design in Ivrea Italy to mobile applications in Singapore, and now advertising user experiences at Yahoo!, Deepak has built up an impressive portfolio of projects. His design courses at leading design programs in India are a testimony to his design thinking, teaching and mentoring abilities. I believe Deepak has the ability to conceptualize, design and prototype signature experiences for the digital canvas and to lead design teams to deliver excellent results.
